# SMF-Toolbar
Google Sheets toolbar add on built to automate and clean NNU's Student Managed Fund's stock portfolio. Written in Google's App Script

## Disclaimer
These tools are specifically tailored for NNU's SMF spreadsheets. This means the specific spreadsheet ranges and ID's will likely not be useful to anyone else. 
However, the general code for extending Google Sheets could be useful to begin modifying this program to fit other sheet structures, and same goes for the automation logic. This code should work with modifications to the ranges and sheet ID's with minimal adjustments accordingly.
